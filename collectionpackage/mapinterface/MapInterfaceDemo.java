**It is not the child of collection interface.
If we want to represent a group of values as key value pairs then we should go for Map interface.
Both keys and values are objects only.
duplicate keys are not allowed, But values can be duplicated.
Each key value pair is called an Entry. Hence map is considered as a collection of entry objects.
