//                     Multithreading
//multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads at the same time.


//                     Multitasking
//Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously.
//we can achieve multitasking in the following two ways.
//1.multiprocessing.(process based multitasking)
//2.multithreading.(thread based multitasking)
//               1.MULTIPROCESSING....
// in multiprocessing each process has an address in memory in other words each process is allocates with separate memory .
//process is a heavyweight..
//cost of communication between processes is high.
//switching from one process to another process will take sometime..
//               2.MULTITHREADING...
//multithreading uses shared area. It does not need separate memory.
//thread is lightweight
//cost of communication is very low
//threads are independent from one to another if there is an error in one thread it does not effect another thread.
